## A Game A Week

I’ve been recommending people asking me how to get into making games to do the exact same thing, with a single update for the social media age. The longer you maintain the challenge, the more experience you have.

* **Make a game every week.** Start the project after Monday 12:00AM and finish it before Sunday 11:59PM. It does not matter whether the game is digital or analog. It does not matter what you use to create the game. The only rule is to make a game.
* **Release the game every week.** Whatever you make, whether it is complete, stable, polished or good, release it to the world through a website you specifically set up for this goal. Spread the link to the page of the game of the week on every social medium you own. Ask people to give you feedback. [WordPress](http://wordpress.com/) or [itch.io](http://itch.io/) are quite capable of handling this.
* **Do not revisit a game.** You can go back and revisit games after you’re done. You cannot work on previous week’s game or idea again the next week. This is not about exploring specific games, this is about gaining experience. If a game is so special it sticks for a while, you can work besides Game A Week or after you’re done. You still have to complete something else each week.
* **Try and avoid patterns in your work.** Try and do something completely different each week. Instead of making digital games, try making an analog game. Instead of making an action game, make a puzzle game. If you find yourself in a pattern, take note of that pattern and break out of it for a week or two before deciding to head back. Make patterns a conscious choice, rather than an accepted and unquestioned reality.
* **Reflect.** Spend each week talking to some people that played your game. Write down your findings in a journal (or in a blogpost, like Adriel Wallick does [at her excellent blog](http://msminotaur.com/blog/)). Write down what you made, what went right, what went wrong and what was interesting.
