I am trying to complete two games per month. In order to achieve this I am imposing some rules on myself. These rules are supposed to keep me on the path that I have chosen and make me aware of my progress.

## 15 days to design and develop a game

Since 48/72 hour long game jams are able to produce original and playable game prototypes, I am confident I can achieve roughly the same at a more relaxed pace. Lately I have split the 15 days into 3 sections:

- early days: inspiration
- mid days: tech tests, gameplay tests & design polish
- late days: full-on development

## Make progress every day

I have 15 days to make a game. That's not a lot of time. I should be making some progress every single day. If I am out of inspiration, move on to the mid-days. If I am confident with the tech and the game elements, move on to the late-days.

Do not rush it. Do not be lazy. Make constant progress.

## Design progress counts only if written down

It's easy to say to myself _"I made progress yesterday because I was thinking about the game"_ but in reality this is usually an excuse. Because of this I decided to only count design decisions that have been written down. A day with no written design decisions and no other type of progress should count as a wasted day.

Another reason to do this is to build some team-skills. I will treat my future self as a separate team member. My forgetfulness will help with this :P


## Playable prototype result

It does not have to be pretty or sound nice. It does not have to be bug-free. It can be slow and consume a lot of memory. These are all things that can be fixed easily given time. The game though has to be **playable** and **fun**.
