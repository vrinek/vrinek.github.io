title: "Ruby 2.2 - Warning: circular argument reference"

Ruby 2.2.0 now warns against a _circular argument reference_. It is pretty simple to demonstrate and pretty difficult to explain so I'll just present some code snippets.

The first example shadows a function (which I have [encountered in one of the open-source projects I'm involved with](https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner/commit/c38119c6f9184610a862ed1aebf271d46e3dd2d0)):

    def foo
      42
    end

    def bar(foo = foo)
      foo
    end

    puts bar.inspect

On ruby 2.1 it just prints `42`. On ruby 2.2 though:

    -e:5: warning: circular argument reference - foo
    nil

The warning refers to the `def bar(foo = foo)` definition. If you remember `a = a` with `a` being an uninitialized variable, initializes `a` with the value of `nil`. Ruby 2.1's function definitions though was not fully following this logic and that disparity was utilized by some developers as a feature. Now in ruby 2.2 this has been fixed and recognized properly.

On the other hand when shadowing a variable instead of a function:

    foo = 42

    def bar(foo = foo)
      foo
    end

    puts bar.inspect

On ruby 2.1 it fails with:

    -e:3:in `bar': undefined local variable or method `foo' for main:Object (NameError)
            from -e:1:in `<main>'

But on ruby 2.2, it recognizes the circular reference:

    -e:3: warning: circular argument reference - foo
    nil

---

To figure out if one's code exploits this feature/bug, one can simply run the following regexp:

    ag 'def +[A-Za-z._!?]+(\(| +)([^)]+, *)?([a-z_]+) *[=:] *\3[^a-z_!?.]'


I'm assuming using [The Silver Searcher](http://geoff.greer.fm/ag/) and not filtering any files based on extension. Otherwise, just replace `ag` with `git grep` and you are good to go.

* **8th October 2015** -- Update regexp to account for keyword arguments and methods ending in "!", "?" -- thanks to Alan & Andreas
