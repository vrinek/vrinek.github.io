My "Two games a month" plan failed. The first one went quite well but the next one...

I can't find a logical explanation that does not sound like an excuse to explain how it went wrong and since I can't rely on logic for this one, I went with my gut and my gut led me to [Rami Ismail's "Game a Week" idea](http://ramiismail.com/2014/02/game-a-week/). After reading through his rules and [MsMinotaur's own experience](http://msminotaur.com/blog/?cat=4), I decided to give it a try.

Logically this would not make sense, if I could not finish a game in 15 days, how would I finish it in 7? I guess pressure. Pressure shifts priorities and I am bad at defining them.

Even if this fails though, the aim is to learn. If I fail and learn from it, the next plan will be more revised and will probably have more chances to work.

Let's see how this one goes.
