The "Game a week" plan failed as well. It was also an experiment and I learned from its failure that I don't have time in my schedule to both work a full-time job and develop a game regularly. Thus I fell back to the simple strategy of developing a game on my free time whenever I have time. It worked for [Gunpoint developer Tom Francis](http://www.pentadact.com/2013-10-15-gunpoint-development-breakdown/) so it might work for me too.

Right now I am working on a simple time-based puzzle game where the player has to let asteroids pas through (and get mined) or destroy them. The trick is to feed the mining space station a balanced diet of colorful asteroids so that the power core does not swerve to any side and blow everything up. The game is for iOS as I wanted to have a go with Apple's Swift.

</div>

The gameplay is nearly done and the graphics are slowly getting implemented. Audio is still a TODO.
