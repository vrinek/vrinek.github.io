I guess blogging every day does not work...

The last few days I have been following a [Swift + SpriteKit tutorial](http://www.raywenderlich.com/75270/make-game-like-candy-crush-with-swift-tutorial-part-1) where the objective is a touch-driven game (like my prototype).

I am starting to like Swift more and more. I especially like how the switch statement can be used to control the flow of the code just like Elixir does with its pattern matching. I should blog about this specific feature in a separate post though.

After (or during) going through the tutorial, I have to generate a paper prototype of the game with all the screens and interactions. After that is done, I'll just start coding and see if the end result is what I envisioned.

I think this experiment is going well ^_^
