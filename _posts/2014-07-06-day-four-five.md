I forgot to blog yesterday. I also made no progress on the design of the game. This means that it is time to take what I have of the game's design and start making something out of it.

I tried to start using Swift and SpriteKit but it looks like there is a lack of documentation on how to use them together. I found [a few tutorials online](http://www.sprite-kit.com/tutorials/). I will have to try a couple of them before I decide if I can complete this game using Swift & SpriteKit.

Just in case, I already have a plan B in mind: Unity. After working on it for the Get into Games challenge, I have grown familiar to both Unity's API and C#'s syntax.

Now it's time for two things:

- **Compile a list of all the game elements I want to try out** (most of them are in [Day three](/game-one/2014/07/04/day-three/))
- **Follow some tutorials, learn more about Swift and SpriteKit**

Wish me luck ;-)
